# Omelas
A 2D point and click game built in Unity.

Stranger to Omelas is a point and click adventure inspired by the short story The Ones Who Walk away From Omelas by Ursula Le Guin. This was a yearlong project for which I was the software designer/programmer. This was my first major Unity project; some of the hurdles included the dialogue system and path finding.
